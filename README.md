Lecturely is a React Native application designed to enhance the interaction between course staff and students during large live lectures. The platform allows course facilitators to adjust lecture pacing based on student feedback, create polls, manage attendance, and feature a discussion board. This board serves as a space for teaching assistants and professors to address student queries and for peers to communicate amongst themselves.
